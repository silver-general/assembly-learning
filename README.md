# assembly-learning
I am trying to learn AVR assembly from scratch.
Assembly programmers usually tell you that it's easy once you master the basis, but still I think the introduction guide might not be as clear as they think, so I'll try to explain then through the eyes of a beginner.

I will try to post guides and thoughts that might be wrong, I will correct them as people following this idea will ask me.
