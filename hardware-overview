# hardware overview

informations are transmitted via BUS, an (assume) 8-bit (0-255 possibilities) line that connects all the elements.

REGISTER FILE

ALU

DATA MEMORY (sram)

PROGRAM MEMORY 
the place where instructions and data are loaded.
FLASH, assume 16bit (2bytes) cells, assume 32kbyte total size

INSTRUCTION REGISTER
received instruction from program memory. assume 16 bits cells (as program memory cells)



RECAP: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TURN ON THE MICROPROCESSOR
---- how is the first command loaded??
1. the intructions are in the *program memory*. they are selected by the *program counter* and sent to the *instruction register*
2. instruction register sends instruction to *instruction decoder*
3. instruction decoder decodes the instruction. there are 3 formats of instructions. see later.
4. register files are used to store temporary data.
