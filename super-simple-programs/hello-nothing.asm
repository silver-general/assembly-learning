// the most basic program: do nothing (use a forever loop)

start:        ; start is a label. it substitutes the address where the program counter starts counting instructions.
  NOP         ; does nothing. 1 clock cycle.
  
// how heavy is this program? 
// every instruction takes 16 bits -> 2 bytes?
