# WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MICROCONTROLLER IS TURNED ON?

here I will illustrate the flow of events that happen during the execution. 
I want to answer to questions such as:
  whats the first thing that happens? what's next?
  who is in charge of selecting the first instruction? is that address a default value?
  
I still have to figure that out myself.
